Todo:
☐ V1
  ☐ UI Tasks 
  - Alarms List Screen
    ✔ ON/OFF Switch on Alarms List (for each alarm) 
    ✔ Redesign to include WakeUp time and Arrival time, and toggle switch

  - Alarm Detail Screen
    ✘ ON/OFF Switch in Alarms Detail  [Not doing - not necessary, and would clutter Alarm Detail too much]
    ✔ Bottom of text is cut off in Label when Editing 
    ✔ Image background for Wake-Up Time clock (not doing SVG anymore because cannot blur edges)
        ✔ In progress - should extend slightly below into the first label (how??)
    ✔ Font for clock 
    ✔ Wake Up Time - format properly (with small caps for AM/PM)
    ✔ Add Task button should be an icon (preferably overlaid a little into the task list)
    ✔ Checkbox color - brandLightPurple
    ☐ Text Input style problem - figure out best way to do this when not so tired.
    ✔ Back button is really hard to Push
    ✔ Checkboxes are hard to push

  - Task Detail
    ✔ Make UI a little nicer - right now its just a skeleton
    ✔ Large 'Delete' button below other fields to delete this task 
    ☐ Bug: Its possible to navigate back to AlarmDetail with Duration picker still open (press Delete or Back) 
        --> handle this (maybe just close the popup on-back)

  ☐ Functionality Tasks
    ✔ Delete Tasks (from Task Detail screen)
    ✔ Dismiss delete button in Alarms list by tapping anywhere (not just on Alarms).
    ☐ ACTUALLY SET AN ALARM (LOL)
        - Now going to try 'react-native-push-notification', instead of the calendar one.

  ✔ BUG: Duration is always '0' in Task Detail screen
  ☐ Start-up screen with 'Mascot' (complex logo character)
  ☐ Style issue: Status Bar is not really visible on any screen

☐ V2
    - Feature Additions
        - Animations
        - Normal Mode (and switching between Normal and Auto mode)
        - Autocomplete Task names in 'TaskDetail' screen
            - History and Common built-in tasks
        - Allow editing of 'Arrival Time' **Label** 
            - Use Case: If I'm working from home, I don't need to 'arrive' anywhere. But I do need to 'Start Working at...'
            - Sometimes it would be useful to be able to change this label
        - Style Changes
            - Find nice fonts
            - More Icons
                ☐ 'Add Alarm' button

    - Alarm Detail Screen
        ☐ Annoying Checkmark layout issue. Can't get the overall circle+checkmark to layout properly without negative margins
            - Even with this hack, the checkmark itself is not exactly centered in the circle
        ☐ Delete tasks from the Alarm Detail screen (in V1 you have to Edit the task)
        ☐ Handle Mode changes
            ☐ Normal Mode: Much larger clock, still has label. 
                        - Also bottom area you can swipe up on to enable the 'Autocalc' mode
            ☐ Auto Mode: As is.
            ☐ Tap or swipe down on Wake-Up Time clock to change from 'autocalc' -> 'basic'
            ☐ Swipe up from bottom "special area" to change from 'basic' -> 'autocalc'
            ☐ Disable/ignore all arrival time and task functionality
            ☐ set Wake Up Time directly (re-use Arrival Time picker)
            ☐ Animate scaling (enlarging/shrinking) the alarm-clock image when changing modes

    - Task Detail Screen
        ☐ Spruce up UI, its a little too minimal

    ☐ Define common fonts in the 'text.js' style file
        - Font for Titles (screen headers)
        - Font for field labels
        - Font for field contents (times, task names, etc)
        - Font for Large Time (we have a decent one already)
        
  
☐ V3

        - Task Types
            - Major: Travel -- requires some integration with Google Maps
        
    - Alarm List Screen
        ☐ Drop shadow for Enabled/Disable button on each alarm.
    - Alarm Detail Screen

    - Task Detail Screen
        ☐ Task types -- ie: travel, dependent on other person, other
