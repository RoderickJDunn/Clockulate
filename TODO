Todo:
☐ V1
  ☐ UI Tasks 
  - Alarms List Screen
    ✔ BUG: After navigating back to this screen, delete button animation "Flies in" from the left, @done(17-11-26 17:30)
        instead sliding in from the right. WTF!???
    ☐ UI Improvement: Alarm row should not flash when sliding to show delete. It would look better
        if it stayed solid while sliding. 
    ✔ Pretty bad performance issues using Swipeout. Maybe switch to RN-Interactive again! @done(17-11-26 17:29)
    ☐ ON/OFF Switch on Alarms List (for each alarm)
    ✔ Redesign to include WakeUp time and Arrival time, and toggle switch
    ✔ "Add alarm" button should have an icon instead of word
    ✔ Added library to handle animation for showing Delete button when swiping @done(17-11-22 22:05)
        ✔ Need to support dismissing the delete button when tapping on OTHER rows or anywhere really @done(17-11-22 22:05)
        ☐ Need to remove unused DeleteButton code. (Component file, as well as some code in Alarms.js)
    ✔ Current issue: AlarmItem is not re-rendered when alarm is toggled. Therefore color of toggle button does not change
        -- SOLUTION: Pass FlatList {this.state} as the 'extraData' prop

  - Alarm Detail Screen
    ✘ ON/OFF Switch in Alarms Detail  [Not doing - not necessary, and would clutter Alarm Detail too much]
    ✔ Bottom of text is cut off in Label when Editing 
    ✔ Image background for Wake-Up Time clock (not doing SVG anymore because cannot blur edges)
        ✔ In progress - should extend slightly below into the first label (how??)
    ✔ Font for clock 
    ✔ Wake Up Time - format properly (with small caps for AM/PM)
    ✔ Add Task button should be an icon (preferably overlaid a little into the task list)
    ✔ Checkbox color - brandLightPurple
    ✔ Text Input style problem - figure out best way to do this when not so tired.
    ✔ Back button is really hard to Push
    ✔ Checkboxes are hard to push
    ☐ If no tasks are on list, show text "Add some tasks" with an swooping arrow pointing to Add button
    ✔ Its in a really weird UI state right now for animation experimenting. Change it back. @done(17-11-19 08:44)

  - Task Detail
    ✔ Make UI a little nicer - right now its just a skeleton
    ✔ Large 'Delete' button below other fields to delete this task 
    ✔ Bug: Its possible to navigate back to AlarmDetail with Duration picker still open (press Delete or Back) 
        ✔-> handle this (maybe just close the popup on-back)

  ☐ Functionality Tasks
    ✔ Delete Tasks (from Task Detail screen)
    ✔ Dismiss delete button in Alarms list by tapping anywhere (not just on Alarms).
    ✔ When navigating back from AlarmDetail to AlarmList, enable the Alarm when Saving. 
    ☐ ACTUALLY SET AN ALARM (LOL)
        - Using 'react-native-push-notification', instead of the calendar one.
        - An alarm with hard-coded time is now set properly (note that notifications don't work on Simulator)

  ✔ BUG: Duration is always '0' in Task Detail screen
  ✘ Start-up screen with 'Mascot' (complex logo character) ----- Not supposed to be Logo. Supposed to be a skeleton of first screen the user sees to "give the impression that the app loaded immediately"
  ✔ LaunchScreen (iOS)
    ✘ Create a LaunchScreen (not splash screen) from Screenshot of blank opening page. 
    ✔ Using storyboard file instead of images. Easier and I think its what Apple wants 
  ✔ Style issue: Status Bar is not really visible on any screen
  ☐ fit background images on different screen sizes properly (different size images, and use Dimensions)

☐ V2
    - Feature Additions
        - Animations
            - Normal Mode <--> Calc Mode  [clock background and layout animations]
        - Normal Mode (and switching between Normal and Auto mode)
        - Autocomplete Task names in 'TaskDetail' screen @high 
            - History and Common built-in tasks

            - Find nice fonts
            - More Icons
    - Alarms List
        ☐ Support re-arranging alarms

    - Alarm Detail Screen
        ☐ Once WakeUp time (and therefore main clock time) always shows the most recently determined time. @high
            - ie) Permanently update WakeUp time when 1) It is re-calculated. 2) It is set directly by the user
        ☐ Autocomplete Task suggestions @high
            - Suggested tasks should provide the name (obviously) and an estimated duration...
            ☐ Assemble list of Tasks and estimated durations to include with the app.

        ☐ Task Type - Travel
            ☐ Open Google Maps view. Input start and destination. 
            ☐ Clockulate will input the appropriate start time for the trip into Google's API, 
                then use the output trip duration from Google Maps
        ☐ Annoying Checkmark layout issue. Can't get the overall circle+checkmark to layout properly without negative margins
            - Even with this hack, the checkmark itself is not exactly centered in the circle
        ☐ Delete tasks from the Alarm Detail screen (in V1 you have to Edit the task) 
        ✔ Tap Clock to go to Normal Mode (trigger the same animation as swiping down) @done(17-11-19 21:36)
            ✔ Trigger the animation by tapping clock @done(17-11-19 10:18)
            ✔ Show a time-picker for Wake-up time @done(17-11-19 21:35)
        ☐ Handle Swipes for additional functionality 
            ✔ Swipe down on Clock: @done(17-11-19 21:35)
                - Takes you from CalcMode --> Normal Mode (Much larger clock, still has label)
                    - Normal mode
                        - In normal mode you can set the wake-up time directly
                        - Normal mode also accessible by tapping the Clock
                        - Disable/ignore all arrival time and task functionality
                    ✔ Transition to Normal mode needs to keep alarm label on screen @done(17-11-19 09:43)
                    ✔ Make the "handle" icon display properly @done(17-11-19 09:43)
                    ☐ Add parralex effect to background image (stars) during this animation
            ✔ Swipe up on Clock (while in Normal mode) @done(17-11-19 21:36)
                - Takes you to AutoCalc mode (makes clock small, and shows task list)
                ☐ Add parralex effect to background image (stars) during this animation
            ✔ Animate scaling (enlarging/shrinking) the alarm-clock image when changing modes @done(17-11-19 21:36)
        ✔ Normal Mode @done(17-11-19 21:36)
            ✔ set the Wake-up time directly in normal mode @done(17-11-19 21:36)

        ☐ Task List
            ☐ Support rearranging tasks (by long-press, then dragging)
        ☐ Menu button and functions
            ☐ Hide disabled tasks
            ☐ Copy another alarm to this one
            ☐ Switch modes (between Normal and AutoCalc)
            ☐ Re-calculate 
    - Task Detail Screen
        ☐ Spruce up UI, its a little too minimal

    ☐ Define common fonts in the 'text.js' style file
        - Font for Titles (screen headers)
        - Font for field labels
        - Font for field contents (times, task names, etc)
        - Font for Large Time (we have a decent one already)

        - Animations
            - Task durations - animate flying to Clock, before updating WakeUp time.

        - Allow editing of 'Arrival Time' **Label** 
            - Use Case: If I'm working from home, I don't need to 'arrive' anywhere. But I do need to 'Start Working at...'
            - Sometimes it would be useful to be able to change this label
  ☐ Android Support 
    ☐ LaunchScreen (Android) -- needs investigation
