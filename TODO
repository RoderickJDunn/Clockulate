Todo:
☐ V1
  ☐ UI Tasks 
  - Alarms List Screen
    ✔ ON/OFF Switch on Alarms List (for each alarm) 
    ✔ Redesign to include WakeUp time and Arrival time, and toggle switch
    ✔ "Add alarm" button should have an icon instead of word
  

  - Alarm Detail Screen
    ✘ ON/OFF Switch in Alarms Detail  [Not doing - not necessary, and would clutter Alarm Detail too much]
    ✔ Bottom of text is cut off in Label when Editing 
    ✔ Image background for Wake-Up Time clock (not doing SVG anymore because cannot blur edges)
        ✔ In progress - should extend slightly below into the first label (how??)
    ✔ Font for clock 
    ✔ Wake Up Time - format properly (with small caps for AM/PM)
    ✔ Add Task button should be an icon (preferably overlaid a little into the task list)
    ✔ Checkbox color - brandLightPurple
    ✔ Text Input style problem - figure out best way to do this when not so tired.
    ✔ Back button is really hard to Push
    ✔ Checkboxes are hard to push

  - Task Detail
    ✔ Make UI a little nicer - right now its just a skeleton
    ✔ Large 'Delete' button below other fields to delete this task 
    ✔ Bug: Its possible to navigate back to AlarmDetail with Duration picker still open (press Delete or Back) 
        ✔-> handle this (maybe just close the popup on-back)

  ☐ Functionality Tasks
    ✔ Delete Tasks (from Task Detail screen)
    ✔ Dismiss delete button in Alarms list by tapping anywhere (not just on Alarms).
    ✔ When navigating back from AlarmDetail to AlarmList, enable the Alarm when Saving. 
    ☐ ACTUALLY SET AN ALARM (LOL)
        - Using 'react-native-push-notification', instead of the calendar one.
        - An alarm with hard-coded time is now set properly (note that notifications don't work on Simulator)

  ✔ BUG: Duration is always '0' in Task Detail screen
  ✘ Start-up screen with 'Mascot' (complex logo character) ----- Not supposed to be Logo. Supposed to be a skeleton of first screen the user sees to "give the impression that the app loaded immediately"
  ✔ LaunchScreen (iOS)
    ✘ Create a LaunchScreen (not splash screen) from Screenshot of blank opening page. 
    ✔ Using storyboard file instead of images. Easier and I think its what Apple wants 
  ☐ LaunchScreen (Android) -- needs investigation 
  ✔ Style issue: Status Bar is not really visible on any screen
  ☐ fit clock background image on iPhone 6 screen properly (different size image)
    - I kind of like the look of the background when you don't see any blur on the sides. ie) Blur is only visible on top and bottom

☐ V2
    - Feature Additions
        - Animations
        - Normal Mode (and switching between Normal and Auto mode)
        - Autocomplete Task names in 'TaskDetail' screen
            - History and Common built-in tasks
        - Allow editing of 'Arrival Time' **Label** 
            - Use Case: If I'm working from home, I don't need to 'arrive' anywhere. But I do need to 'Start Working at...'
            - Sometimes it would be useful to be able to change this label
        - Style Changes
            - Find nice fonts
            - More Icons
                ☐ 'Add Alarm' button

    - Alarm Detail Screen
        ☐ Annoying Checkmark layout issue. Can't get the overall circle+checkmark to layout properly without negative margins
            - Even with this hack, the checkmark itself is not exactly centered in the circle
        ☐ Delete tasks from the Alarm Detail screen (in V1 you have to Edit the task)
        ☐ Handle Swipes for additional functionality 
            ☐ Swipe down on Clock:
                - Takes you from CalcMode --> Normal Mode (Much larger clock, still has label)
                    - Normal mode
                        - In normal mode you can set the wake-up time directly
                        - Normal mode also accessible by tapping the Clock
                        - Disable/ignore all arrival time and task functionality
            ☐ Swipe up on Clock (while in Normal mode)
                - Takes you to AutoCalc mode (makes clock small, and shows task list)
            ☐ Swipe from right to left
                ☐ Shows an overlay with additional information
                    - How much sleep you'll get if you fall asleep NOW
                    - Total time of all enabled tasks to do in the morning
                    - Weather now and tomorrow
                    - 
            ☐ Animate scaling (enlarging/shrinking) the alarm-clock image when changing modes
        ☐ Menu button and functions
            - Hide disabled tasks
            - Copy another alarm to this one
            - Switch modes (between Normal and AutoCalc)
            - 
    - Task Detail Screen
        ☐ Spruce up UI, its a little too minimal

    ☐ Define common fonts in the 'text.js' style file
        - Font for Titles (screen headers)
        - Font for field labels
        - Font for field contents (times, task names, etc)
        - Font for Large Time (we have a decent one already)
        
  
☐ V3

        - Task Types
            - Major: Travel -- requires some integration with Google Maps
        
    - Alarm List Screen
        ☐ Drop shadow for Enabled/Disable button on each alarm.
    - Alarm Detail Screen

    - Task Detail Screen
        ☐ Task types -- ie: travel, dependent on other person, other
            - most will be other

    ☐ Profiles
